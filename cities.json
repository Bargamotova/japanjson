        "Tokyo was formerly (until 1868) known as Edo, the name of the small fishing village that existed on the site for centuries. Edo's development into a city did not occur until the Tokugawa period (1603–1867), when it became the capital of the Tokugawa shogunate. During this period, however, the imperial family remained in Kyōto, the ancient imperial capital. With the Meiji Restoration of 1868, which ended the shogunate, the capital was moved to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo, meaning \"eastern capital.\" ",
        "Tokyo is home to the Tokyo Skytree, recognized by Guinness World Records as the world's largest tower. While the tower was under construction, its developers found out that the Canton Tower, built about the same time in Guangzhou, China, would be roughly the same size as the Skytree; soon thereafter, an antenna measuring some 20 metres (67 feet) tall was added to the top of the Skytree.",
        "The blooms of the cherry tree, known in Japan as sakura, have long been of immense symbolic importance to the nation, and the blossoming of cherry trees traditionally heralds the arrival of spring in Japan; in an annual tradition that began in 1951, meteorologists publicly forecast the much-anticipated blossoming of the cherry trees each year."

In the early years of the Heian period (794-1192)  the temple was reestablished in the north-east of Kyoto. However, over time it again fell into a dilapidated condition, until only three structures were left: the main hall, the Jizo Hall and the temple gate.In 1922, to preserve what was left, it was decided to dismantle the temple's remaining structures and reassemble them in their current location. Despite the move, the temple's misfortunes continued when a major typhoon caused terrible damage in 1950. ",
            "In 1955, the temple's fortunes began to change when a new head priest was appointed. His name was Kocho Nishimura and he began the long process of renovating the temple. Kocho Nishimura was not only a priest but an accomplished sculptor of Buddhist statues. He hit on the idea of having visitors carve their own statues for the temple under his guidance. These “rakan” statues, which represent Buddha's disciples, were all added to the temple between 1981 and 1991, but look much older as they are now fairly covered with moss. Because each statue was carved by a different person, each one is completely unique, and many have humorous expressions or whimsical poses."

The Tenryu-ji temple is also nearby, its northern entrance overlooking the bamboo grove.Several paths wind through the heart of the large bamboo forest of Sagano. The walk is short (about 500 meters), however, one of the most famous and pleasant in the city. The bamboo grove of Arashiyama is known throughout the world, and is, like the torii of Fushimi Inari or the Kiyomizu Dera, a must-see for visitors!",
            "To the Japanese, bamboo represents strength and prosperity, thus adored and protected by the government and locals. Bamboo is also known to repel the forces of evil, which explains the presence of Tenryu-ji right next to it.",
            "The bamboos there are truly immense, and their tops reach several tens of meters high. This intensely green, very dense forest lets a few rays of sun filter through in good weather. The atmosphere is unique, relaxing, and almost magical. When the wind blows, you can hear the familiar rustling and squeaking of the stems bending in the breeze. ",
            "It is not possible to get lost in this bamboo grove as visitors are guided on the paved pathway. The path can be quite crowded with visitors during the days thus for those who prefer less crowd, we recommend you make your visit early in the day before the rush of tourists and visitors. "

It’s cosmopolitan history is epitomized by the massive star-shaped Fort Goryokaku – a Western-style citadel turned public park that is one of Hokkaido’s top spots for cherry blossom viewing.",
        "The best time to see Hakodate is at night. Mount Hakodate, a forested mountain at the city’s southern tip, offers magical views of the city and surrounding waters below which glow with the lights of squid fishing boats. You can reach the mountain at any time of the day; by hiking, driving or cable car. ",
        "Another reason to vote for Hakodate is the great food available. Being surrounded by the ocean on three sides, the fish in any number of the city’s restaurants is always fresh. The city’s speciality is squid, which comes in a variety of forms from raw and wriggling to deep-fried and even as ice-cream. Ramen, too, is popular, with the Hakodate version adding kelp, seafood, and/or squid to a delicious, warming broth."

            "Mt. Hakodate is a 334-meter-tall peak overlooking Hakodate that is famous for its spectacular views of the city and the bay. It offers one of Japan’s three best night views, along with Mt. Rokko in Kobe and Mt. Inasa in Nagasaki City. When the weather is clear, seeing the city lights of Hakodate with the ocean on either side can be an unforgettable experience.",
            "The sweeping view of Hakodate City and the surrounding ocean and mountains atop Mount Hakodate was enabled through the construction of the mountaintop viewing platform in 1953 and the ropeway linking the mountain’s base and summit in 1958.",
            "The night view from the mountain summit is very popular.The viewing platform has four floors. The first floor is the mountaintop station for the ropeway and the waiting lobby, the second floor has restaurants and an event hall, the third floor has a tea lounge and other spaces, and the top floor has the rooftop viewing platform. The pleasant trip on the ropeway to the top is a convenient three minutes. In addition to the ropeway, a bus connects outside JR Hakodate Station to the mountaintop (about 30 minutes), or a mountain trail can be used to climb to the summit."

It has been developed as a park and is renowned as a cherry blossom viewing spot, where as many as 1,500 cherry trees bloom in summer. You can also get a good view of the beautiful cherry blossoms from the moat, in a rowing boat. ",
            "The cherry blossoms are lit up at night to create an enchanted atmosphere. Apart from the cherry blossoms, you can also enjoy the beautiful scenery each season, such as various flowers, red leaves, and the winter scenery. ",
            "The observation deck of Goryokaku Tower, which stands next to the park, overlooks Goryokaku and offers a sweeping view of Hakodate and the Tsugaru Straits. For history buffs, we recommend visiting Hakodate Magistrate's Office, which used to be the government office for the Edo Shogunate, located within the park premises. The rooms of the office at the time have been reproduced, and materials and videos introducing the history of the Magistrate's Office and Goryokaku are also available here.",

        "Dubbed the “Hawaii of Japan”, the eponymous main island is just one of more than 160 that make up the Okinawa prefecture – an archipelago trailing like a strand of pearls towards Taiwan. Some of the islands are inhabited, simply a slip of untouched white sand lapped by azure seas, while others are scattered with luxury resorts at the edge of pristine dive sites. Others, still, like the far-flung Yaeyama Islands, are thick with jungle, lush mangrove swamps, rivers and waterfalls.",
        "The favoured local drink is awamori – which, like sake, contains rice as its main ingredient but that’s where the similarities end. Distilled, not brewed, the local spirit packs a punch, with an alcoholic content ranging from 30 to 43 per cent. Awamori distilleries are scattered throughout the islands, Awamori distilleries are scattered throughout the islands, where you can take a tour to learn how the drink is made, then sample a glass or three. Proceed with caution.",
        "Okinawa is a melting pot of cultures and cuisines. You’re less likely to find sushi on the menu and more likely to find pork, thanks to the Chinese influence. You’ll find Okinawa soba noodles made with wheat, not buckwheat, and taco rice, credited to the Americans. Famed as an area where people live longer than average, a diet rich in tofu, seaweed and yam is said to contribute to the longevity of the locals. Don’t miss the sea grapes – a local seaweed delicacy that pops in the mouth – or mozoku, a stringy and crunchy seaweed rich in fucoidan which is unique to Okinawa.",
        "Until Okinawa’s collapse to Japan in 1609, the independent Ryukyu Kingdom governed the islands. You can get an insight into its imperial past matsuri festivals like Naha Great Tug-of-War Festival held in October. More recently, it was the site of one of the bloodiest campaigns of World War II – and to this day, US Forces (Japan), still have a large presence on the islands.",
        "You’ll find Japan’s largest reef in the prefecture, and Okinawa is home to the country’s best dive sites with spectacular diving available throughout the islands. You can spot everything from manta rays in Ishigaki to underwater caves near Miyako and hammerhead sharks off Yonaguni. Even beginners can get in on the action on a beach dive off Okinawa Island.",
        "Interestingly, Okinawa is where karate comes from. It might have spread like wildfire throughout the world but the sport was practised here long before being annexed by mainland Japan in 1879 – and it remains the best place to learn the combat art."

            "The Churaumi Aquarium has many claims to fame: it has a giantic tank called the Kushiro Sea Tank, one of the largest in the world, with a whale shark and the world's first successfully bred-in-captivity manta ray. The aqaurium also boasts the first instance of multiple whale sharks in capitivity. The tank itself measures over eight meters tall and over 22 meters wide. The tank is named Kushiro because of the warm Kushiro Current, which has a huge impact on the sea life of Okinawa. ",
            "The aquarium also features a recreation of the Sea of Okinawa through reproductions of Okinawan coral. The coral has been cultivated for over a decade, and the 300 square meter tank has no roof, allowing sunlight to flood in. Fish and other marine life that would naturally inhabit coral reefs swim there and play an important role in controling seaweed and other plants that inhibit the growth of corl. ",
            "Interestingly, the aquarium also uses an \"open system\" where sea water from the Sea of Okinawa enters the tanks and then is returned to the ocean, keeping the flow of water fresh and constant. ",
            "There is also a tank dedicated to deep-sea life, where mysterious organisms from 200 to 700 meters deep in the Sea of Okinawa have been bred in captivity like Ruby Snapper, Blacksail Snake Mackerel, and luminious shrimp. "

In the narrowest sections the ceiling of stalactites have been cut off to allow the headroom for people to walk through.
